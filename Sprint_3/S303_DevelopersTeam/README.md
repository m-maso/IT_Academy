## My personal experience
I don’t know if it can help someone but I would like to share some of the lessons I have learnt while developing this group project and also express my gratitude to the people that have walked that path with me.

If at the beginning of the project you’ve asked me which troubles do you expect to encounter I’d probably started to enumerate you a list of things related to the project itself. I would have never expected to undergo a chain of personal setbacks from all team members at the same time. This situation has forced us to learn to deal with setbacks and keep going even if it feels like an obstacle course.<br>
I’ve to say that amid of the chaos the madness of my computer has joined by deleting some of the files we were working. (Don’t get me wrong, I usually save my files and make daily backups) But lesson learned, now I don’t delay the time to make a commit. I also encountered some pitfalls with git-github and eclipse, which had made some days long and tiring. And on those days you will feel really grateful to have not judging and supporting team-members and mentor around you. If you don’t have it, give yourself the love you need.

I feel blessed to have a mentor who provided me with a safe net. That we can be honest which each other, talk about the ugly truth of the project, about the hurdles we encounter while developing it. I think it’s really important to keep him updated about which stage of the project we are in.<br> 
Ivan, I am really grateful to you, for your patience, for being understanding and for being a ‘tough love leader’ which leads me to improve as a team member and don’t let myself be defeated by the setbacks. You really have set the bar high for my future boss ;)

I also feel grateful that my mentor has paired Alicia and I with Lex as a team members. Alicia and I, as we share Ivan as a mentor we know each other previously. That’s not the case with Lex whose mentor is Romina (Romina, hope to know you better in the next project). With Lex we went from total strangers to being a nice team-mate. He makes me feel supported, I can be myself and that’s a lot of comfort for someone shy as me.<br> 
I feel blessed that our team created a nice working environment whereas in person or remote.  

I’d say that it’s important that you respect and trust your team members, do not judge them for their mistakes. Sometimes we make silly mistakes fruit of the stress or personal situations, so be able to laugh about that can release some of the stress and make the other team-mate feel safe and looking forward to thrive and improve themselves. Today it’s your mistake, tomorrow mine.<br>
When you create a safe environment where you can talk openly and share your different points of view everyone it’s going to give their best.<br>
Try not to take things personal, your code can also be improved for another team member, share your knowledge with your team, listen to them, learn from them.

And last and not least, sense of humour betters everything in life. I’d say laugh, laugh, laugh...it’s a curative agent after a setback, a nice balm after a silly or not silly mistake, it improves the mood of the team and it helps to feel you closer with your team members. And then you have no fear to go ahead on new paths hand on hand with your team-mate.<br>
Lex, thanks for the patience and the laughs, let’s learn spring and then finish the DDD and Hexagonal Architecture project ;)  
 
In the near future I’m going to create a repository with my takeaways about the technical setbacks.
