- Create the database in MongoDB Compass by using the file 'restaurants.json' which contains the collection "restaurants".<br> 
Database name: "restaurantsNY" and collection name: "restaurants"
- Use the integrated Mongosh, write the command: 'use restaurantsNY' to switch from 'test>' to the "restaurantsNY" database or write: 'use <database_name>' if you've saved the database with another name.
- Be aware that all queries use "restaurants" collection (db.restaurants)
